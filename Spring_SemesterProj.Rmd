## Overview

## Concept 
#Why power analysis?

When we conduct hypothesis testing, we either result in accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis to make conclusion about a treament in an experiment.  If an experiment results in rejecting the null hypothesis, however, it is due to one of two reasons: chance, or real effects.
