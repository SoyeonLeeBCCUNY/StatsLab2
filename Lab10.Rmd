1. From Chapter 20, reproduce the bat and hat example (20.2) in R. Your code should represent the data in long-form, conduct the ANOVA, and report the ANOVA table. You will know if you did it correctly if you can reproduce the ANOVA table from the textbook. (3 points)
```{r}
library(tibble)
#replicate textbook example
bat_hat_data<-tribble(~Subject, ~Phonological_Similarity, ~Age, ~num_correct,
                      "s1","b1","a1",15,
                      "s2","b1","a1",23,
                      "s3","b1","a1",12,
                      "s4","b1","a1",16,
                      "s5","b1","a1",14,
                      "s1","b2","a1",13,
                      "s2","b2","a1",19,
                      "s3","b2","a1",10,
                      "s4","b2","a1",16,
                      "s5","b2","a1",12,
                      "s6","b1","a2",39,
                      "s7","b1","a2",31,
                      "s8","b1","a2",40,
                      "s9","b1","a2",32,
                      "s10","b1","a2",38,
                      "s6","b2","a2",29,
                      "s7","b2","a2",15,
                      "s8","b2","a2",30,
                      "s9","b2","a2",26,
                      "s10","b2","a2",30
                      )

aov_out<-aov(num_correct~Phonological_Similarity * Age + 
             Error(Subject/Phonological_Similarity),
             data=bat_hat_data)

summary(aov_out)
```

2. From Chapter 21, reproduce the phonological similarity example (21.2.1) in R. Your code should represent the data in long-form, conduct the ANOVA, and report the ANOVA table. You will know if you did it correctly if you can reproduce the ANOVA table from the textbook. (3 points) Note, the F-value for the phonological similarity factor that you find with R may not be the same as the textbook. The textbook produces the quasi-F, and it is OK if you do not.
```{r}
#long format data
subject<-rep(c("s1","s2","s3","s4"),each=10)

Typicality_B<-rep(rep(c("b1","b2"),each=5),4)

Faces_A<-rep(c("a1","a2","a3","a4","a5"),8)

centiseconds<-c(20,22,25,24,19,37,37,43,48,45,
                9,8,21,21,21,34,35,35,37,39,
                18,20,18,21,33,35,39,39,37,40,
                5,14,16,22,23,38,49,51,50,52)

face_data<-tibble(subject,
                  Typicality_B,
                  Faces_A,
                  centiseconds)

#run the anova

aov_out<-aov(centiseconds~(subject +
                             Faces_A%in%Typicality_B +
                             Typicality_B +
                             Typicality_B:subject), 
             data=face_data)

summary(aov_out)
```

Bonus points:
3. Use R to produce the missing quasi_F value for problem 2.
